# Memory-Centric Analitical Model for FPGA Applications Compiled with High Level Synthesis

This repository includes the data collected from profile and the Jupyter notebooks with the memory model equations proposed. Aplication folder contains a set of benchmarks to validate the proposed model.

The model was developed usign the Quartus aocl version 18.1 for Stratix10 GX an 19.4 for Stratix10MX


### Prerequisites

Jupiter notebook environment and a web browser are mandatory.

Instructions to install and execute Jupyter notebooks can be found in this link: [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)

## Getting Started

The cell of the notebooks requires to be executed following the strict sequential order for the model valuation.
The FPGA model folders have the reports with the necesary information for the model.
