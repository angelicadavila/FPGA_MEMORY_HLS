# Analytical Model of Memory-Bound Applications Compiled with High Level Synthesis

This repository includes the data collected from profile and the Jupyter notebooks with the memory model equations proposed, and their application in selected benchmarks. 


### Prerequisites

Jupiter notebook environment and a web browser are mandatory.

Instructions to install and execute Jupyter notebooks can be found in this link: [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook)

## Getting Started

The cell of the notebooks requires to be executed following the strict sequential order for the model valuation in FCCM2020_MEM_MODELING.ipynb
The applications folder contains the aocl reports of each evaluated benchmark.
